## In App Purchase 2 Starter Kit
### Starter Kit for one time purchases in your Ionic App

### This project is now unsupported - If you would like to take over from here, please dm me.

The cordova ecosystem for in-app purchases is confusing to wade through and difficult to implement, but don't fear, because I have you covered. In this plugin, I have implemented @ionic-native/inapppurchase2 and shown how to conifigure, track, and purchase something in app. Features include

* Ionic 3.X Compatible 
* Apple & Google Integration Example
* [Blog Post Detailing Out The Implementation](https://medium.com/@andrew.thielcole/in-app-purchases-with-ionic-3-af13b21f49f2)
* Configure The IAP2 store
* Configure Each Item
* One Time Purchase
* List Items For Sale
* Purchase Items
* Restore Purchases

### To Run

* Configure Apple / Google Store
* Create An Example Product To Purchase
* Clone this repo
* Change your apple / google store id in the config.xml file
* Add your product id to the page you want to test
* Run your app in a simulator or real device!

### Implementation Notes

This app will only work on a simulator or real device. You will also need to configure the appropriate store and products in order to test purchases. 

If your interested in subscription purchases, create an issue or even submit a pull request yourself to add that functionality.
